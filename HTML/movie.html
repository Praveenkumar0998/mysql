<p><h3>Casting</h3></p>
<p>Suriya played the role of Nedumaaran Rajangam (Maara), an ambitious man from Madurai; the character is loosely based on G. R. Gopinath.[18] He said his character "is prone to anger ... Even in anger, he is able to think of why certain people are coming from a different perspective. He knows how to behave with his wife, his friends and others". Sudha fixed these elements before filming to make the performance look consistent.[17] He also did few physical transformations;[19][20][21] For scenes of the character as a young man, Suriya had lost almost 20 kg (44 lb) to gain physique for the role.[22]
Suriya plays Nedumaaran Rajangam and Aparna Balamurali plays Sundari. Their characters are based on G. R. Gopinath and his wife Bhargavi.
Aparna Balamurali was signed to play the female lead, working with Suriya for the first time.[23][24] Her character Sundari was modelled on Gopinath's wife Bhargavi.[25][26] Aparna also learnt the Madurai dialect for the film.[24] In June 2019, Telugu actor Mohan Babu was signed to appear in the film.[27] He immediately accepted the role when approached, and dubbed in his own voice.[28] Soorarai Pottru is also the acting debut of Arjunan's son Ilan and daughter Iyal.[29]
Bollywood actor Paresh Rawal was cast as the antagonist Paresh Goswami, making his Tamil debut.[30] The character is based on Naresh Goyal, CEO of Jet Airways.[31] Dan Dhanoa appeared in a short role as Vimal Balaiyya, which was inspired by Indian businessman Vijay Mallya.[32] Sheik Maideen, who had a close resemblance to former president of India A. P. J. Abdul Kalam and was popularly known as "Udumalai Kalam", played the character inspired by Kalam;[33] Maideen's voice was dubbed by Naveen Muralidhar.[34] R. Madhavan gave the narration for the film.[35]</p>
